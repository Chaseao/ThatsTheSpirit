	It was the night of the annual Ghost & Ghoul Jamboree. All the big shots were there: Casper, The Bell Witch, Bloody Mary, even The Ghost of Christmas Past. You had tried for years to get in. As the world’s most internet-famous self-proclaimed ghost hunter, it was the chance of the century.
However… things didn’t go as planned…
Because you fell in love! With a ghost.
Congrats?
	As you were totally not crashing this party that was only supposed to be for supernatural beings, the lovely host of the establishment came up to you and BAM! Love at first sight.
	You’re not really sure what they were saying to you (something about not being welcomed here?) but the next thing you know, you were being thrown out of the mansion.
	Now you’re back at the haunted mansion where the Jamboree was held. Except instead of seeking answers to the afterlife, exorcising ghosts, or asking if Twilight was based on real-life events (you never did get an answer to that one), you’re looking to impress your spook-tacular crush!
